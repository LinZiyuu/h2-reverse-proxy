# Recommended minimum Access Permission configuration:
#
# Deny requests to certain unsafe ports
# http_access deny !Safe_ports

# Deny CONNECT to other than secure SSL ports
# http_access deny CONNECT !SSL_ports

# # Only allow cachemgr access from localhost
# http_access allow localhost manager
# http_access deny manager

# We strongly recommend the following be uncommented to protect innocent
# web applications running on the proxy server who think the only
# one who can access services on "localhost" is a local user
#http_access deny to_localhost

#
# INSERT YOUR OWN RULE(S) HERE TO ALLOW ACCESS FROM YOUR CLIENTS
#

# Example rule allowing access from your local networks.
# Adapt localnet in the ACL section to list your (internal) IP networks
# from where browsing should be allowed
# http_access allow localnet
# http_access allow localhost

# And finally deny all other access to this proxy
# http_access deny all

# Squid normally listens to port 3128
# http_port 3128
# http_port 3128 accel defaultsite=echo-server no-vhost # 3128 为 squid 监听端口， echo-server 为后端 Host
# cache_peer echo-server parent 8001 0 originserver name=myAccel # 需要配置好转发的 Host 的端口

http_port 3128 accel defaultsite=origin no-vhost
cache_peer 127.0.0.1 parent 80 0 originserver name=myAccel

acl all src all
http_access allow all

# 关闭缓存
# cache deny all

# Uncomment and adjust the following to add a disk cache directory.
#cache_dir ufs /var/cache/squid 100 16 256

# Leave coredumps in the first cache dir
# coredump_dir /var/cache/squid
